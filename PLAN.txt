OVERVIEW
--------

Text-based strategy is a simple turn-based strategy game rendered in the
console as ASCII characters. This is the immediate precursor to the
CombatCubes engine, which will be integrated once all gameplay is
completed.

PURPOSE
-------

Ultimately I usually want to make a game, but end up building an engine
instead. This deliberately low-tech approach has been selected to remove
the allure of pretty graphics and force me to work on gameplay,
recognizing the graphics can be added on to a good game more easily than
a bad game can be fixed to match pretty graphics.

GAME FIELD
----------

At first, the game will be entirely rendered on an 80x120 ASCII text
field. The middle 80x80 square will be the playing field, with the
remaining 40 characters serving as a menu and status area on the left.

GAME PLAY - SINGLE PLAYER
-------------------------

Single-player gameplay will flow similar to other turn-based strategy
games. There are two players to a game, one controlled by a human and
one controlled by a computer.  Each player's unit will receive an 
initiative value, and the order of play for a turn will take place in 
decreasing order of initiative value. A unit moves across the field of
play with a set number of action points. These action points are
deducted for each action performed by a unit, be it simple movement
across terrain or attacking the enemy. The first player to meet the
victory conditions of the current battle wins.

Gameplay is balanced through the use of a point-value system. Each unit
has a calculated point value, and each battle has a maximum total army
value. Player armies are built out of available units until the maximum
total is reached (it cannot be exceeded). This total can be weighted to
one side or the other to increase or decrease battle difficulty.

Maps for single-player battles are either pre-set (scenario mode), or
selected by the player (free play mode), or determined by preconditions
(campaign mode). They can also be designed through the use of a level
designer.

GAME PLAY - MULTIPLAYER
-----------------------

Multiplayer gameplay is similar to single-player in the sense that the
two players take turns according to initiative rolls. The primary
difference (aside from the extra human) is that maps are built
communally, and that point values for the battles are agreed upon before
the match begins.

UNITS
-----

Units are comprised of several attributes:

- attack Power (P)
- Damage capacity (D)
- Action points (A)

These values are used to determine a unit's worth in the following way:

unit_worth = A(P+D)

The purpose for this is to assert that more action points makes a unit
more effective. For example, a unit with PDA of (1,1,1) will only act
half as many times as a unit with PDA of (1,1,2), meaning the second
unit is ostensibly twice as powerful.

Combat between units is extremely basic. When unit A attacks unit B,
unit A's P is subtracted directly from unit B's D. Once unit B's D is
zero or lower, unit B is destroyed. If unit B survives, their reduced D
value is maintained until healed or the unit is defeated in combat. If
unit B survives the attack of unit A, combat ends.
